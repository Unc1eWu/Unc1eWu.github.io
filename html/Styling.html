                    <p>Yohji’s most significant contribution to the fashion industry as we know it today may have been his Paris debut runway show in 1981. With their debut shows, both he and Rei Kawakubo introduced the world to Japanese fashion in a major way. European fashion houses dominated the global fashion zeitgeist at this time - eastern fashion was not widely credited or highly regarded on a global scale yet.</p>

                    <p>Yohji Yamamoto’s style is typically defined as deconstruction where garments appear to be unfinished, raw, falling apart, and above all, imperfect. Yamamoto finds beauty in the imperfect perhaps because true perfection in our world is merely impossible.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, you will find that his clothing may sometimes be ill-fitting. By not accentuating the curves of a woman’s body or the broad build of a man’s physique, the clothing becomes androgynous and the buyer’s gender becomes irrelevant.
                    </p>
                    <p>He typically utilizes black which emphasizes more his deconstructed look and may sometimes apply details on one side of the garment that will not appear on the other, conveying a sense of asymmetry.

                        Yohji Yamamoto, along with Rei Kawakubo (designer of Comme des Garcons) and Issey Miyake are three highly influential Japanese designers of our time and their influence in fashion will surely be nothing short of a legacy.</p>
